# Snake-AI
**A Q-Learning algorithm that plays snake**

Run *train.py* to start the AI training. Progress is saved every 1000 episodes. By default the algorithm runs in demo mode, that slows down the frame rate and forces the snake to exploit rather than explore. Press the "Up Arrow" key to switch to the training mode, "Down Arrow" to switch back to the demo mode, "Space" to pause the program, "Enter" to resume and "End" to close.

*demo.py* runs the trained algorithm that has played 1000000 episodes

*play.py* runs the playable version of the game (Use arrow keys to control the snake)
